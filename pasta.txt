To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand cat emoji. The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of nuanced emotions, most of the usage will go over a typical discorder's head. There's also scrumge's subtle mixture of mutual suffering and schadenfreude, which is deftly woven into each pixel - the smile draws heavily from sebastian's pain laugh when faced with a daunting celeste level, for instance. Cat emoji users understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these emotions, to realize that they're not just disapproving- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence, people who dislike cat emoji truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in scunge's reproachful yet stupified visage. I'm scronging right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as each cat emoji and it's genius unfolds itself on their discord client. What fools... how I pity them. And yes by the way, I DO have a disapproval tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they can properly use scringe in a real sentence.
