# <img src="scrumge.png" width=40/> scrumge [pain laugh]

The meta feeling of schadenfreude that you get from laughing at internal
suffering, either by means of empathy or because you're actually suffering.
Some people seem to use the upside down smile emoji for this purpose.
This is the only emoji with a black border.

## example

Bob: So in order to disable that context menu...

Bob: Yes, you have to be TrustedInstaller and then you can disable it.

Alice: <img src="scrumge.png" width=20/> that's so bad hahaha.
