The first of the cat emotes, this emoji conveys a stern look that is more
general in nature than the rest of the cat emotes.

## where

One of my friends has a cat named Thumper that constantly looks like he's
glaring. Thumper's gaze is so strong that he needs to be moved around the house
so that his sheer, concentrated disapproval doesn't bore holes in whatever object
he is staring at.
